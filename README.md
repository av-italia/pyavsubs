# pyavsubs

Here you can find the software I use to manage the process/team
involved in Italian subtitles creation for (long) YouTube videos, in
case it could be useful for someone else. Our first subbed video was
[this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJ9kGZMbyVw).

This is a Python port of [this](https://github.com/lbraglia/lbav2) R
package, using the [srt](https://github.com/cdown/srt) library.
